<p>This is my first blog post on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> running <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Special thanks to those who created the <a href="https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Clean Blog</a> theme!</p>

<p>Since I already have a website at <a href="http://michaelqtlam.com">michaelqtlam.com</a>, I'm honestly not sure what this website will contain other than a blog in which I currently do not have anything to blog about anyway. I'm guessing this website will also contain links to my current projects and their descriptions. Please come back as I continue to evolve my web presence!</p>

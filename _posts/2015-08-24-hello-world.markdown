<p>This is my first blog post on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> running <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I am using the <a href="https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Clean Blog</a> theme.</p>

<p>I hope this research blog will be educational. I plan to share some stuff I have learned along the way. My main website is still located at <a href="http://michaelqtlam.com">michaelqtlam.com</a>.</p>
